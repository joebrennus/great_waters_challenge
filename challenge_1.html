<h2>What we're supposed to do.</h2> <p>Introduce yourself and your watershed to the GWC community!</p>

<p>Tell us about you: Who are you and where are you from? Where do you live now? How did your ancestors/family arrive there? On which Traditional Territory (i.e. Treaty or unceded land) do you reside?</p>

<p>Tell us about your connection to water: Can you tell us a cool water story you have? Why are you excited about the Great Waters Challenge?</p>

<p>Tell us about your community: What watershed do you belong to? Find out the name and the boundaries of your watershed and briefly share a local water challenge that concerns you.</p>

<p>Be creative with your entry - in my case it's going to be a website - Use only your first name when you introduce yourself. Keep it short and sweet.</p>
